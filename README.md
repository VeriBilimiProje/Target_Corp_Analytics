#### Overview 🚀 

This project aims to predict customer satisfaction and identify the factors that influence it using an e-commerce dataset. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, order details, payment information, and product characteristics. By analyzing this data, we aim to build machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction and provide insights into the key drivers of customer satisfaction.


#### Dataset 📝 

Our data set consists of 36 variables and over 100 thousand observations. olist e-commerce websites in Brazil cover the years 2016-2018.
Some of these variables:

   -  customer_city: City of the customer.
   -  order_status: Status of the order.
   -  order_purchase_timestamp: Date and time of the order purchase.
   -  order_approved_at: Date and time when the order was approved.
   -  order_delivered_carrier_date: Date and time when the order was handed to the carrier.
   -  order_delivered_customer_date: Date and time when the order was delivered to the customer.
   -  order_estimated_delivery_date: Estimated delivery date of the order.
   -  review_score: Review score given by the customer.
                                    
  

#### Feature Engineering📑 

1. **Date Features:**
   - Extracted year, month, day, hour, and minute from date columns.
   - Calculated time differences between various order stages (e.g., approval time, delivery time).
2. **Categorical Features:**
   - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features such as payment type and order status.
   - Mapped product categories to higher-level categories.
3. **Numerical Features:**
   - Scaled numerical features using RobustScaler.
     
#### Modeling 🖥️ 
Models Used
1. **Logistic Regression**

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors**

3. **Classification and Regression Trees**

4. **Gradient Boosting Machine**

- **F1 Score** 

- **ROC-AUC Score**

#### Conclusion 🚀

This project successfully identified key factors influencing customer satisfaction. The most significant features were:


   - Order Delivery Time: Orders delivered on time received higher satisfaction scores.
   - Payment Method: Certain payment methods correlated with higher satisfaction.
   - Product Category: Some product categories had consistently higher satisfaction rates.

You can find out the estimated delivery date by filling in the required fields here and pressing the estimate button.

On the review score prediction page, which is another of our models, we can see customer satisfaction with a prediction success of 98% after filling in the required fields.
